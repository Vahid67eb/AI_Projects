Introduction

In this notebook, I've used CNN to perform Image Classification on the Brain Tumor dataset.
Since this dataset is small, if we train a neural network to it, it won't really give us a good result.
Therefore, I'm going to use the concept of Transfer Learning to train the model to get really accurate results.
If you find this notebook helpful and intuitive, feel free to upvote it! Do give me your suggestions or opinions so that I can improve my work! I will highly appreciate it! Thank you! :)
